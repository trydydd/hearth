# CafeBox — Agent Build Plan

A self-contained offline community server running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
Broadcasts a WiFi hotspot, intercepts captive portal detection, and serves
content through a clean landing page. Extensible by design: each service is
an independent systemd unit routed through a single nginx reverse proxy.

This project is a spiritual descendant of **PirateBox**:
- **Offline during operation** (no WAN required; no runtime downloads)
- **Builder can download during build** (CI/local build may fetch upstream releases)
- **Hotspot-only** access (all user traffic arrives via the AP)
- **Assume hostile clients** (treat every connected device as untrusted)
- **Anonymous-by-default for users**, but **hardened-by-default for the box**
- Content is **curated by the operator** (admin uploads), not an anonymous public dropbox
- **Prebuilt image**: flash SD card → power on → works

## Build-time vs Runtime Responsibilities

This is a personal project, so keep the workflow simple and pragmatic.

- **Build-time (builder/CI)**
  - Allowed to download upstream releases (Conduit, Element Web, Kiwix tools, Navidrome, etc.)
  - The resulting **image must be self-contained** so the box can run offline
  - Prefer pinned versions for repeatable releases (optional early on, but recommended)

- **Runtime (on the deployed box)**
  - No WAN required
  - No runtime downloads
  - Only render configs, manage services, and handle operator uploads

---

## Central Configuration

**`cafe.yaml`** — The only file an operator ever needs to edit.

All system-level configs are **auto-generated** from this file by `scripts/generate-configs.py` using
Jinja2 templates.

(Example omitted here for brevity; see the repo for the full sample config.)

### Service Identity Map (Naming Consistency)

CafeBox deals with three different “names” for the same conceptual service:

- **Tile id**: what the portal shows and what `/api/public/services/status` returns.
- **systemd unit**: what `systemctl` controls.
- **storage key**: what `storage.locations.*` uses.

APIs use **tile ids**. Internals map tile ids → unit/storage keys.

---

## Stage 0 — Base Infrastructure

### 0.0 — Threat Model & Network Policy (Offline / Hostile Clients / Hotspot Only)

- No WAN routing/NAT for clients.
- Admin reachable from hotspot; portal must not link to admin.
- Default-deny firewall; allow only DHCP/DNS/HTTP on hotspot interface.
- Enable AP client isolation if feasible.

### 0.4 — nginx Captive Portal

Change Android `/generate_204` handler to redirect to the portal:

```nginx
location /generate_204 { return 302 http://{{ box.domain }}/; }
```

### 0.6 — Landing Portal

The portal uses `GET /api/public/services/status`.

### 0.8 — First-Boot Credential Generation (Password Banner)

Keep the password banner:
- On a freshly flashed image, generate a random admin password on first boot.
- Display it on the landing page until the operator changes it.

---

## Stage 1 — Admin UI

- Clarify SessionMiddleware is signed-cookie based unless a server-side store is added.
- Add a simple CSRF defense: require CSRF token header on state-changing requests.
- Use a dedicated `cafebox-admin` user; tighten sudoers.

## Stage 2 — Matrix Chat (Conduit + Element Web)

### 2.0 — Reality Check: E2EE vs Ephemerality

CafeBox does not promise messages are erased when users disconnect.
